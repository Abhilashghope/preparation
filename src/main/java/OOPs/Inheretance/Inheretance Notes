Code Reuse → No need to repeat id, name, phoneNumber in every user type.

Hierarchy Modeling → Natural mapping: User → Customer, User → DeliveryAgent.

Polymorphism → You can treat all users as User type in APIs.

User u = new Customer(...);
u.displayInfo();  // works


Maintainability → If you add a field like email in User, all child classes get it automatically.

In general OOP, there are 5 types of inheritance:

Single Inheritance

Multilevel Inheritance

Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance

Hybrid Inheritance

But 👉 in Java, only the first three are directly supported with classes.

Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes (to avoid diamond problem), but you can achieve it via interfaces.
