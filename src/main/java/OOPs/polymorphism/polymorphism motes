Perfect 👍 — **Polymorphism** is one of the most asked OOP topics in Java/Spring Boot interviews. Let me break it down with **definition, types, real-world code, and Spring Boot examples**.

---

## 🔹 What is Polymorphism?

👉 Polymorphism = *"many forms"*
It allows the **same method name** or **interface** to behave differently depending on the object at runtime.

In Java:

* **Compile-time polymorphism** → achieved by **method overloading**.
* **Runtime polymorphism** → achieved by **method overriding** (most used in Spring Boot).

---

## 🔹 Types of Polymorphism

### 1. **Compile-time polymorphism (Static binding)**

* Method is resolved at **compile time**.
* Done using **method overloading** (same method name, different parameters).

```java
class PaymentService {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paying " + amount + " using cash");
    }

    public void pay(int amount, String upiId) {
        System.out.println("Paying " + amount + " using UPI: " + upiId);
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
PaymentService service = new PaymentService();
service.pay(100);             // Cash
service.pay(200, "user@upi"); // UPI
```

---

### 2. **Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic binding)**

* Method is resolved at **runtime**.
* Achieved using **method overriding + inheritance + upcasting**.

```java
class PaymentService {
    public void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("Processing generic payment");
    }
}

class UpiPaymentService extends PaymentService {
    @Override
    public void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("Processing UPI payment");
    }
}

class CardPaymentService extends PaymentService {
    @Override
    public void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("Processing Card payment");
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
PaymentService payment = new UpiPaymentService();
payment.processPayment();  // Output: Processing UPI payment

payment = new CardPaymentService();
payment.processPayment();  // Output: Processing Card payment
```

---

## 🔹 Why is Polymorphism important in **Spring Boot**?

1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
   Spring injects beans polymorphically.

```java
public interface PaymentService {
    void processPayment();
}

@Service
@Primary
public class UpiPaymentService implements PaymentService {
    public void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("UPI payment processed");
    }
}

@Service
public class CardPaymentService implements PaymentService {
    public void processPayment() {
        System.out.println("Card payment processed");
    }
}

@RestController
public class PaymentController {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    // Spring can inject UpiPaymentService OR CardPaymentService
    public PaymentController(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/pay")
    public void pay() {
        paymentService.processPayment();
    }
}
```

Here, **polymorphism lets the controller depend only on the interface**, not a concrete class.

---

2. **Spring Data JPA**
   Repositories extend `JpaRepository<T, ID>` — Spring generates implementations at runtime.

```java
public interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {}
```

You can polymorphically call repository methods on any entity-specific repository.

---

3. **Spring Security**
   `UserDetailsService` has multiple implementations (`JdbcUserDetailsManager`, `InMemoryUserDetailsManager`).
   Spring injects the correct implementation polymorphically.

---

## 🔹 Interview-ready Answer (2–3 sentences)

> Polymorphism means "many forms," where the same interface or method can behave differently. In Java, it comes in two forms: **compile-time (overloading)** and **runtime (overriding)**. In Spring Boot, polymorphism is widely used in **dependency injection, JPA repositories, and Spring Security**, where interfaces define contracts and multiple implementations provide different behaviors.

---

👉 Do you also want me to prepare **common interview questions around polymorphism** (like “Why is polymorphism important for Spring DI?” or “Difference between overloading and overriding”)?
