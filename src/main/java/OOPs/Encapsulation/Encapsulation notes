Data Hiding → Phone number/address not directly accessible, prevents misuse.

Validation → Ensure only correct data is set (e.g., phone = 10 digits).

Flexibility → You can change internal logic without affecting other parts of code.

Security → Sensitive info (like payment details, OTP, addresses) stays safe.
